# Implementation notes (read before the handoff's own brief)

The handoff in this folder was written for a plan the owner changed. Where it disagrees with these notes, these notes
win. WebYar (Iranian edition) was implemented first, on 2026-10-17; RESPOK (International edition) is still to do.

## Owner decisions

1. **The look live today stays the default.** Template `default` (and `intl`) is byte-identical: it was NOT restyled
   in place, contrary to brief §3. Both designs were ADDED as new templates.
2. **Neutral ids, names in the database.** Template 1 "Classic" is `t1`, Template 2 "Simple home" is `t2` (files
   `public/widget/presentation-t1.*` / `presentation-t2.*`, globals `__gs_presentation_t1` / `_t2`). The names people
   see live in the Super Admin's catalog, per dashboard language, renamable at any time; they never appear in an id, a
   file name, a class or the widget config. Default names: «آشنا» / «فیروزه» / «نسیم» (Familiar / Turquoise / Breeze)
   for `default` / `t1` / `t2`. The handoff's `simple` / `simple-intl` ids were not used. RESPOK later:
   `t1-intl` / `t2-intl`.
3. **Persian text is IRANSans only.** Vazirmatn is not shipped, loaded or referenced anywhere in the widget (the
   handoff's font files were left out of the repository). Both new templates use the shared
   `presentation-default-fonts.css` (IRANSans for Persian, InterWY for Latin): no new font bytes, and no clash with the
   call widget's single `gs-presentation-fonts` link. Weight 600 renders with the IRANSans 700 file, 800 with 700.
   Screenshots therefore differ from the PNGs in glyph shapes and text widths only.
4. **The Super Admin enables templates; a workspace owner chooses among the enabled ones.** New templates are disabled
   after a deploy until the Super Admin enables them, so a deploy changes nothing for any visitor.

## Where things are

| Concern | Code |
| --- | --- |
| Template descriptors, editions | `shared/widgetTemplates.ts` (`EDITION_CHAT_WIDGET_TEMPLATES.iran.offered = ['default','t1','t2']`), `public/widget/presentation-registry.js` |
| Catalog rules (enabled, default, names, options) | `shared/chatTemplateCatalog.ts` (pure, server + dashboard) |
| Storage | migration `database/migrations/275_widget_template_catalog.sql`: `widget_edition_settings.chat_templates` (one row per edition), `widget_settings.widget_template_id` / `widget_template_options`, KB rating `neutral` |
| Server | `server/services/widget/templateCatalog.ts`, `server/routes/adminWidgetCatalog.ts` (`GET/PUT /api/admin/widget-catalog`), `server/routes/widgetSettings.ts` (`GET /:ws/templates`, PATCH fields), `configSnapshot.ts` (`templateId`, `templateOptions` in the cached config) |
| Dashboard | Super Admin → widget settings → «قالب‌های ویجت»; Widget → Appearance → «قالب ویجت» (`TemplateChoiceCard.tsx`); the live preview renders the effective template |
| Core features | renderer-declared `features` + Core's `env.capabilities` (`docs` in `public/widget/runtime.js`, search `feat(`); `default` declares none, so its runtime path is unchanged |
| Screens for visual QA | `e2e/harness/templateScreens.ts` (`--template t1 --out <dir>`, `--list` for the states, design demo data) |

Template options (merged: code defaults → Super Admin defaults → workspace): t1 `navStyle` (`vb` default, `va`, `vc`,
`vd`), `navMode` (`active` default, `both`, `icon`, `text`, `none`), `topics` (≤ 4); t2 `topics`, `askExamples` (≤ 2).

## What the designs draw that is not built (renders nothing)

No backend exists for these yet; the renderers draw nothing for them (`env.capabilities` false), never a dead control:
the conversation rating card (CSAT) and transcript by email, message reactions, the order card and "track an order"
row, instant answers while typing, step-by-step pre-chat (`prechatMode: steps`), the queue position and wait, the
header ⋯ menu, the in-thread offline auto-reply with an e-mail card, and the new launcher shapes and glyphs of the
"launcher and colour" board (the loader has no budget left for them).

## Rollout

- Migration 275 is applied by hand on WebYar's database before the merge (CLAUDE.md); RESPOK's migrator applies it on
  push. Every read tolerates it being absent (the catalog then reads as "only the edition default").
- After the deploy, the Super Admin enables `t1` / `t2` in «قالب‌های ویجت»; workspace owners then see «قالب ویجت».
